        <h1>Use Case</h1>
        <p>This site is for the publishing of coursework for BYU-I CSE 121B JavaScript by Brennon Jacobson. Each week
            will be contained in an isolated page. Links to each week are located in the nav bar as well as below in 
            the pattern of Week/Description. 
        </p>
        <p>Each week will have a nav to the home page only. I will not maintain a nav bar accrossed the entire course 
            as each week will be an isolated subsite. 
        </p>
        <h2><a href="week02/task2.html">Week02</a></h2>
        <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>This week will discuss using variables in Javascript: declaring, typing, primitive
            values, and object values. We will then take a closer look at Arrays and doing comparisons. Finally the 
            Document Object Model (DOM) will be introduced.</p>
        <h2><a href="week03/task3.html">Week03</a></h2>
        <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>This week will dive deeper into Arrays by introducing some very helpful provided 
            helper methods. Functions and modules will be introduced to help us keep our Javascript code DRY and organized, 
            and finally we will learn how to harness DOM events to react to user input.</p>
        <h2><a href="week04/task4.html">Week04</a></h2>
        <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>This week will introduce object literals in Javascript and then give us some 
            opportunities to practice everything we have learned so far.</p>
        <h2><a href="week05/task5.html">Week04</a></h2>
        <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>This week will review conditionals and loops in Javascript. You will then be 
            introduced to making AJAX requests with Fetch.</p>
